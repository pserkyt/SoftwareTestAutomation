## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through the use of various testing methods, I can ensure my software is both functional and secure. The two most common methods of testing software is to write test cases (usually by a tester,) and to write unit tests. Unit tests are written by the programmer can be run automatically within seconds. Unit tests ensure the software behaves as expected and save time and money by quickly tracking down bugs.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The testing stage of the SDLC is absolutely vital to ensure high-quality software that covers the clientâ€™s needs. Testing ensures that software functions as it was designed and intended to function, as well as ensuring the software implements all functionality as was required by the client.
## How do I approach designing software?
After taking this course, I have learned that it is absolutely essential to write tests. I will now approach designing software by first writing a class and its methods, then immediately writing a unit test for that class before moving on to the next class.
